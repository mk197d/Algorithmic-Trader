# Algorithmic-Trader
Course Project: Data Structures and Algorithms (Autumn 2023)

The project involved the development of a sophisticated market system focused on optimizing order matching between traders. Key aspects of the project included:

Optimization of Order Matching: Implemented a market system that enhances the efficiency of order execution by optimizing the matching process between buy and sell orders.
Order Cancellation Rules and Matching Policies: Conducted an in-depth study of various order cancellation rules and matching policies prevalent in financial markets to improve the overall efficiency of order execution.
Arbitrage Detection Algorithms: Developed and designed complex algorithms aimed at detecting arbitrage opportunities within financial markets. These algorithms were successfully translated into practical trading strategies to capitalize on price discrepancies.
Network Sockets and Multithreading: Gained hands-on experience with network sockets and multithreading concepts. Applied this knowledge to create a stock market simulation system, mimicking real-world client and market interactions.
